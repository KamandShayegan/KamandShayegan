 - I am a computer engineer enthusiast who dedicated most of her time to developing mobile applications.
 - I have nearly 3 years of development experience.
 - I am great at spotting weak points and problematic concepts, and I can confidently say that am great at teamwork.
 - I have invested significant time in learning about product development, such as the user interface, mobile applications, websites, and APIs.
 - 🌱 I’m currently learning how to work with data, and that is why I am studying for a master's degree of Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) at the University of Oulu.

 - And lastly, learning new things is fun (after running 🏃🏻‍♀️ of course)! 😄
